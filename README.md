# LowerColorado

The Basin View tool for the Lower Colorado River Basin (LCRB) is a water-use analytics dashboard submitted to and awarded by the United States Bureau of Reclamation Data Visualization Challenge. The visualization is created using R markdown, leaflet, and shiny in order to provide a wide variety of audiences with useful information about the current status and historic water use in the LCRB. Leaflet is used to display multiple shapefiles with hover-over and reactive activity. The tidyverse packages are heavily utilized to process and visualize data queried over the web.
